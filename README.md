# latin-rythym-identifier
A classifier using Parzen Probability Neural Network (PPNN) algorithm in MATLAB to classify a 16-bit input into four classes of 4-bit outputs. 
The feed-forward algorithm classified clave direction,
a rhythmic-regulative principle in Afro-Latin music similar to a key in a
music, 
into four different types of clave direction classes based on
partido-alto paradigm

Data for this classifier was obtained from
